===============

This repository is used as a means of saving and sharing waypoints. Feel free to fork and send in a pull request. The points of interest that are being tracked 
are displayed below.

**Note:** The file `duplicate.bat` is used to update the waypoints across all servers. For instance, if you play on `us8-public.minez.net` and you add some waypoints, run `duplicate.bat us8-public.minez.net` before committing to update every other waypoint file.
